Lesson 1: Basic Kivy App
========================

 In this series of tutorials, I will be teaching you how to make GUI apps with
Kivy. Kivy is an open-source cross-platform hardware-accelerated multi-touch GUI
framework for Python. Let's start by taking a look at our import statements:

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label

 The first one imports the Kivy app class and the second one imports the Label
class. Every Kivy app must define an app class that extends the Kivy app class:

class HelloApp(App):
    """A basic Kivy app."""
    def build(self):
        """Build the UI."""
        return Label(text = "Hello World!")

 Our app class must override the "build" method of the Kivy app class. The 
"build" method must return the root widget for our app. In this lesson, we will
simply return a label widget containing the text "Hello World!".

 We also need to create an instance of our app class and call its "run" method:

HelloApp().run()
